\section{Neutrinos and the Standard Model}
\label{sec:neuAndSM}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven to be an enormous
success. From a handful of ingredients---three gauge groups, three generations of
quarks and leptons, the Higgs field, and 18 free parameters---the SM provides a
succinct and precise description of nature that agrees incredibly well with the
bulk of experimental observations.

However, even if we ignore the glaring absence of gravity in the theory (a
difficulty inherent to quantum field theory itself), there are clear and
exciting signs that new physics must lie beyond the Standard Model. For
instance, the SM fails to explain dark matter, dark energy, cosmic inflation,
the lightness of the electroweak scale, and the matter/antimatter asymmetry of
the Universe, among other puzzles.

These are difficult problems which may take decades to resolve, and in most
cases there is little clarity on how the SM will need to be extended along the
way. On the other hand, the last half-century has produced overwhelming evidence
of another Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effect, one that admits a relatively
successful quantitative description: neutrino oscillations. Before discussing
this phenomenon, it is worthwhile to review the story of the neutrino itself.

More than a century ago, measurements of nuclear beta decay gave the surprising
result that the energy of the outgoing electron was continuously distributed, in
stark contrast to the discrete lines observed in alpha and gamma decay. If, like
alpha and gamma decay, beta decay were a two-body process, then a continuous
spectrum would seem to imply the violation of energy and momentum conservation.
Furthermore, it had been observed that nuclear spin is either integral (for even
mass numbers) or half-integral (for odd mass numbers), implying that the nuclear
spin can only change by an integer during beta decays, which conserve the mass
number. And yet, the electron has a spin of 1/2, so a two-body process would
also imply the nonconservation of angular momentum. Did all of this mean that,
alas, it was necessary to discard the most sacred conservation laws of physics?

An alternative resolution, one that would avoid violations of the conservation
laws, was proposed in 1930 by Pauli, who postulated the existence of an
unobserved, light, neutral particle, or ``neutron'', contained in the nucleus
and emitted along with the electron in beta decay. Chadwick's 1932 discovery of
the actual neutron led Fermi to redub Pauli's hypothetical particle as the
\emph{neutrino}. Fermi's 1933 theory of beta decay, which incorporated the
neutrino, was successful in reproducing the measured electron spectra, but the
neutrino itself would not be directly observed for another two decades.

In 1956, antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor were detected by the Cowan-Reines
experiment, marking the first direct confirmation of the neutrino's existence.
Over the decades that followed, it was found that neutrinos come in three
distinct ``flavors''---electron, muon, and tau, corresponding to their charged
lepton partners---and that neutrinos lack any discernable mass. These qualities
would eventually be incorporated into the Standard Model, which crystallized in
the 1970s after a period of remarkable theoretical and experimental progress in
particle physics.

In the SM, the three neutrinos are massless left-handed Weyl spinors that
interact only via the W and Z bosons. Masslessness is theoretically appealing,
as it avoids the need to imbue the theory with right-handed neutrinos (which
have never been observed) or Majorana mass terms (which are not present for any
other SM particle); in addition, because beta decay observations indicate that
the neutrino mass must be \emph{very small} if it is nonzero, masslessness
avoids the need to explain such unnatural smallness in comparison with the other
particles of the theory. Although some puzzling neutrino observations, discussed
next, had been known since the late 1960s, massive neutrinos were seldom given
serious consideration as the explanation. But as experimental evidence continued
to mount, this wall would eventually have to crumble, leading to the revolution
that has transpired over the last few decades.

\section{History of neutrino oscillations}
\label{sec:history}

Half a century ago, deep in South Dakota's Homestake mine, Ray Davis filled a
large tank with tetrachloroethylene, a common dry-cleaning agent, and waited as
solar neutrinos interacted with chlorine-37 atoms via the reaction
\begin{equation*}
  \mathrm{\nu_e + \ ^{37}Cl \longrightarrow \ ^{37}Ar + e^-.}  
\end{equation*}
The argon, bubbled out and counted every few weeks, was by the early 1970s
clearly indicating a reaction rate that was one-third of the prediction derived
from the Standard Solar Model (SSM). This ``solar neutrino problem'' was
interpreted to mean that either the SSM or the experiment was in error, and
neutrinos remained, according to the wisdom of the day, massless.

Despite the prevailing belief in masslessness, the possibility of massive
neutrinos, and the resulting potential for oscillations, was considered as early
as 1962, after the discovery that neutrinos come in separate electron and muon
flavors. That year, an obscure and then-unacknowledged paper by Maki, Nakagawa,
and Sakata (MNS) introduced the idea. Some five years before MNS, in 1957,
Pontecorvo had been the first to propose the idea of neutrino oscillations, but
in the form of neutrino-antineutrino oscillations, in analogy with the
(then---)recently discovered phenomenon of neutral kaon mixing. A decade later, in
1967, Pontecorvo independently raised the prospect of flavor oscillations, going
so far as to suggest that solar neutrinos could oscillate, well before the first
experimental hints of such by the Davis experiment. Still, it would take decades
of further obervations to prove that these four theorists were correct.

The mid-1980s delivered additional anomalies, when the IMB and Kamiokande
experiments observed a deficit in the number of charged-current atmospheric
\(\mathrm{\nu_\mu}\) events relative to expectations, while also confirming the
solar neutrino problem, which was yet again confirmed around 1992 by the
gallium-based SAGE and GALLEX radiochemical experiments. In 1996, the massive
Super-Kamiokande (SK) water Cerenkov detector came online, and in 1998 the SK
collaboration published measurements of the zenith angle dependence of the
atmospheric neutrino deficit. This geometric dependence was consistent with
mass-induced flavor oscillations. Other models, such as neutrino decay or
decoherence, were disfavored by the SK data. SK's best-fit oscillation model
provided initial indications of \(\theta_{23}\) and \(\Delta m^2_{32}\), assuming that the
model was indeed correct, which would require further confirmation.

This confirmation came in 2002, thanks to the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
(SNO). Owing to its use of heavy water as the target material, SNO had
unprecedented sensitivity to neutral current (NC) interactions, which are
undergone by all three neutrino flavors. This NC sensitivity stood in addition
to SNO's customary sensitivity to charged current (CC) interactions, which (at
solar energies) only provide detection of electron neutrinos. As such, SNO was
capable of independently measuring both the total and the electron neutrinos
fluxes. The total flux was in excellent agreement with the SSM, demonstrating
that the ``missing'' neutrinos underlying the solar neutrino problem were, in
fact, merely hiding in the form of muon and tau neutrinos.

At this point, the existence of neutrino oscillations was no longer a question.
The precision era had begun, and KamLAND was one experiment that had gotten a
head start. Around the time of SNO's announcement, KamLAND published results on
the disappearance of reactor antineutrinos over long ($\sim$100~km) baselines.
These oscillations are controlled by $\theta_{12}$ and \(\Delta m^2_{21}\), the former of
which had previously been constrained by the solar neutrino problem. KamLAND's
measurements were in agreement with the solar neutrino observations, and
furthermore provided what remains the most precise measurement of
\(\Delta m^2_{21}\) ever performed.

Meanwhile, the atmospheric results of SK and others on \(\Delta m^2_{32}\) had set
off a flurry of successful long-baseline accelerator experiments, such as K2K,
T2K, MINOS, and NO$\nu$A, optimized for this mass splitting and designed to narrow
down its value and that of $\theta_{23}$. As the 2010s approached, however, one
mixing angle remained elusive: $\theta_{13}$.

The disappearance of electron neutrinos is controlled by $\theta_{12}$ and
\(\Delta m^2_{21}\) at longer baselines (such as those employed in solar experiments
and KamLAND) and by $\theta_{13}$ and \(\Delta m^2_{31}\) at shorter baselines. As luck
would have it, at the energies of reactor antineutrinos, the latter oscillation
length is $\sim$1~km, which is a sufficiently short distance that a relatively
modest target mass of $\sim$100~tons will provide ample statistics from a typical
commercial power reactor. The CHOOZ experiment in France had attempted to
observe $\theta_{13}$, but due to uncertanties in the reactor flux normalization, it
was only able to set an upper limit of 0.17 on \(\sin^22\theta_{13}\).

In order to mitigate this uncertainty, the subsequent generation of reactor
experiments were designed using multiple identical detectors at different
baselines. This would enable the near detectors to measure the flux while the
far detectors measure any oscillation. Uncertainties on the absolute flux thus
largely cancel in the far/near ratio. The Double CHOOZ, RENO, and Daya Bay
experiments embarked on this effort in parallel. This thesis describes, in
detail, an analysis of Daya Bay's data in order to extract $\theta_{13}$ and the mass
splitting.

\section{Neutrino oscillation physics}
\label{sec:oscPhysics}

Neutrino oscillations are the consequence of two facts: First, that the flavor
eigenstates are not the same as the mass eigenstates (\emph{mixing}), and
second, that the mass eigenvalues aren't fully degenerate (implying that at
least one is nonzero). As a result, a flavor eigenstate is a superposition of
mass eigenstates which each undergo phase rotation at their own rates; the mass
components thus interfere to produce different flavor compositions over time,
leading to the observation of oscillations.

The neutrino fields in the flavor and mass bases are related by the
Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, $\upmns$ (or simply $U$):
\begin{equation*}
  \nu_\alpha = U_{\alpha i} \nu_i,
\end{equation*}
that is,
\begin{equation*}
  \flavcol = \underbrace{\upmnsSimple}_{\upmns} \masscol.
\end{equation*}
It can then be shown that the \emph{states} (as opposed to the fields) are
related by the complex conjugate of $U$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nuStateRel}
  \ket{\nu_\alpha} = U^*_{\alpha i}\ket{\nu_i}.
\end{equation}
$\upmns$ can be parameterized in terms of the three mixing angles, $\tAB$,
$\tBC$, and $\tAC$, along with a CP-violating complex phase
$\dcp$:\footnote{Although a general 3x3 unitary matrix includes six complex
  phases, in this case five of them can be absorbed into the definitions of the
  neutrino and charged lepton fields, leaving only one remaining. It could be
  inserted anywhere in the factorization of $U$ as long as unitary is preserved,
  but by convention the definition in (\ref{eq:upmnsParam}) is what is used.}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:upmnsParam}
  \begin{split}
    U &= \upmnsFactored \\\\
    &= \upmnsFull.
  \end{split}
\end{align}
where \(c_{12} \equiv \cos\theta_{12}\), etc. It is these mixing angles (or trigonometric
functions thereof), and not the matrix elements themselves, that are directly
measured by experiments.

Physically speaking, neutrinos are produced in processes that are localized in
space and time. A fully microscopic treatment of neutrino oscillation would
therefore involve modeling each neutrino as a wave packet of definite initial
flavor. However, given a bulk flux of neutrinos from a spatially extensive
source, the oscillation probability for neutrinos of energy $E$ can be
calculated by simply considering a spacetime-filling plane wave. This approach
ignores effects caused by interference and decoherence of wave packet
components; however, these effects were shown to be completely insignificant
under the experimental conditions at Daya Bay [XXX wave packet paper].


To calculate the oscillation probability over baseline $L$ for a neutrino of
energy $E$ and initial flavor $\alpha$, we first redefine the problem slightly and
consider a neutrino plane wave $\ket{\nu(t)}$ of initial flavor $\alpha$ and
well-defined \emph{momentum} $\vec{p}$, such that
\(E = |\vec{p}|\).\footnote{One could instead assume a well-defined
  \emph{energy}, or even \emph{velocity}, and the end result would be the same
  to leading order. The advantage of fixing the momentum is that it provides a
  spatially uniform flavor composition at all times, so we need only worry about
  the time dependence.} This state contains components of three very slightly
different energies, one for each mass eigenstate. For clarity, flavor and mass
eigenstates will be labeled with the superscripts F and M, respectively.
Following [XXX Giunti], we have
\begin{equation*}
  \ket{\nu(0)} = \ket{\nuF_\alpha} = U^*_{\alpha i} \ket{\nuM_i}. 
\end{equation*}
This state evolves in time like
\begin{equation*}
  \ket{\nu(t)} = e^{-i E_i t} U^*_{\alpha i} \ket{\nuM_i}.
\end{equation*}
Given that we've fixed the momentum $\vec{p}$, the energy $E_i$ of the $i$th
mass eigenstate component of $\ket{\nu}$ is
\begin{equation*}
  E_i = \sqrt{p^2 + m_i^2} \approx p + \frac{m_i^2}{2p} \equiv E +
  \frac{m_i^2}{2E}.
\end{equation*}
This gives, after we discard the global phase evolution $e^{-iEt}$,
\begin{align*}
  \ket{\nu(t)} &= \exp\left(-i\frac{m_i^2t}{2E}\right) U^*_{\alpha i} \ket{\nuM_i} \\
             &\approx \exp\left(-i\frac{m_i^2L}{2E}\right) U^*_{\alpha i} \ket{\nuM_i},
\end{align*}
since, for a relativistic neutrino, \(t \approx L\). The probability of measuring this
state to be of flavor $\beta$ is then
\begin{align*}
  P(\alpha \rightarrow \beta)
  &= \left|\Braket{\nuF_\beta|\nu(t)}\right|^2
    = \left| \Bra{\nuM_j} U_{\beta j} \exp\left( -i\frac{m_i^2L}{2E} \right) U^*_{\alpha i}\Ket{\nuM_i}\right|^2 \\
  &=  \left| U^*_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i} \exp\left( -i \frac{m_i^2L}{2E} \right)\right|^2 \\
  &= U^*_{\alpha j} U_{\beta j} U_{\alpha i} U^*_{\beta i} \exp\left( -i \frac{\Delta m^2_{ji}L}{2E} \right),
\end{align*}
where \(\Delta m^2_{ji} \equiv m^2_j - m^2_i\). This can be rewritten by separating the
terms for \(i = j\) and \(i \neq j\), giving
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:oscSepSums}
  P(\alpha \rightarrow \beta) = \sum_{j} |U_{\alpha j}|^2 |U_{\beta j}|^2
  + 2 \Re \sum_{j>i} U^*_{\alpha j} U_{\beta j} U_{\alpha i} U^*_{\beta i}
  \exp\left( -i \frac{\Delta m^2_{ji}L}{2E} \right),
\end{equation}
where, for clarity, we are explicitly indicating the summations. Going further,
we can employ the unitarity relation
\begin{equation*}
  U_{\alpha j} U^*_{\beta j} = \delta_{\alpha \beta}
\end{equation*}
which, upon squaring, gives
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_j |U_{\alpha j}|^2 |U_{\beta j}|^2 = \delta_{\alpha \beta}
  - 2 \sum_{j > i} \Re(U^*_{\alpha j} U_{\beta j} U_{\alpha i} U^*_{\beta i}).
\end{equation*}
Substituting this into (\ref{eq:oscSepSums}), and using Euler's identity, along
with the trigonometric identity \(1 - \cos 2\varphi = 2\sin^2 \varphi\), we finally get
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:oscReIm}
  \begin{split}
    P(\alpha \rightarrow \beta) = \delta_{\alpha \beta} &- 4\sum_{j > i} \Re(U^*_{\alpha j} U_{\beta j} U_{\alpha i} U^*_{\beta i})
    \sin^2 \left( \frac{\Delta m^2_{ji}L}{4E} \right) \\
    &+ 2\sum_{j > i} \Im(U^*_{\alpha j} U_{\beta j} U_{\alpha i} U^*_{\beta i})
    \sin \left( \frac{\Delta m^2_{ji}L}{2E} \right). \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
Note that this result applies to \emph{neutrinos,} not antineutrinos. For the
latter, we have, analogously to (\ref{eq:nuStateRel}),
\begin{equation*}
  \ket{\nubar_\alpha} = U_{\alpha i}\ket{\nubar_i}
\end{equation*}
(note the lack of complex conjugation on the matrix element). The preceding
derivation then produces (\ref{eq:oscReIm}) with the complex conjugations
swappped.

In an experiment like Daya Bay, where we are looking for the
\emph{disappearance} of (anti)neutrinos of a given flavor, our interest is in
\(P(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha)\). In this case, the behavior of neutrinos and antineutrinos is the
same, and (\ref{eq:oscReIm}) simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
  P(\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) = 1 - 4 \sum_{j>i} |U_{\alpha j}|^2 |U_{\alpha
    i}|^2 \sin^2\left( \frac{\Delta m^2_{ji} L}{4E} \right). 
\end{equation*}
The matrix elements from (\ref{eq:upmnsParam}) can then be inserted in order to
derive the disappearance probability for a particular flavor. For electron
antineutrinos, as at Daya Bay, the survival probability is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:survProbDybFull}
  \begin{split}
    P(\nubar_e \rightarrow \nubar_e) =
    1 &- \cos^4\theta_{13}\sin^2 2\theta_{12} \sin^2 \Delta_{21} \\
    &- \sin^2 2\theta_{13}\left( \cos^2\theta_{12} \sin^2 \Delta_{31} + \sin^2\theta_{12} \sin^2
      \Delta_{32}\right),
  \end{split}
\end{align}
where we've introduced the notation
\begin{align*}
  \Delta_{ji} &\equiv \frac{\Delta m^2_{ji}L}{4E}
           \approx \frac{1.267\, \Delta m^2_{ji}\,\mathrm{[eV^2]}\;
           L\,\mathrm{[m]}}{E\,\mathrm{[MeV]}}.
\end{align*}

At Daya Bay, \(\sin^2 \Delta_{21}\) is so small that the experiment has no ability to
constrain $\theta_{12}$ or \(\abs{\Delta m^2_{21}}\). In this analysis, then, their values
are fixed to those measured by KamLAND (XXX global?). This leaves $\theta_{13}$,
\(\abs{\Delta m^2_{31}}\), and \(\abs{\Delta m^2_{32}}\). However, given that the
difference between \(\abs{\Delta m^2_{31}}\) and \(|\Delta m^2_{32}|\) is less than one
part in thirty, distinguishing between their corresponding phases would require
some combination of a high-resolution detector and a baseline long enough to
stretch out the phase difference. At Daya Bay, the baseline of $\sim$1~km is
approximately one oscillation length, where the detector resolution is
insufficient for resolving the difference. Therefore, Daya Bay cannot measure
the two splittings jointly. On the other hand, since \(\Delta m^2_{21}\) is well
constrained and known to be positive, we can tightly relate
\(\abs{\Delta m^2_{31}}\) and \(\abs{\Delta m^2_{32}}\):
\begin{equation*}
  \abs{\Delta m^2_{31}} =
  \begin{cases*}
    \abs{\Delta m^2_{32}} + \Delta m^2_{21}, & normal hierarchy ($\Delta m^2_{32} > 0$), \\
    \abs{\Delta m^2_{32}} - \Delta m^2_{21}, & inverted hierarchy ($\Delta m^2_{32} < 0$), \\
  \end{cases*}
\end{equation*}
Thus, by using this relation to eliminate one parameter, it is possible to to
perform a two-parameter fit of (\ref{eq:survProbDybFull}) directly,
\emph{provided that the mass hierarchy is specified}. Since the mass hierarchy
is currently unknown, two sets of results must be reported; furthermore, they
are subject to change if an improved determination of \(\Delta m^2_{21}\) is ever
published.

Alternatively, we can recast (\ref{eq:survProbDybFull}) in a form that refers
only to an empirical \emph{effective} mass splitting \(\Delta m^2_{ee}\):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:survProbDybEE}
  P(\nubar_e \rightarrow \nubar_e) \approx 1 - \cos^4\theta_{13}\sin^2 2\theta_{12} \sin^2 \Delta_{21}
  - \sin^2 2\theta_{13}\sin^2\Delta_{ee},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta_{ee} \equiv \frac{\Delta m^2_{ee}L}{4E}. 
\end{equation*}
It must be noted that (\ref{eq:survProbDybEE}) is not an exact
reparameterization of (\ref{eq:survProbDybFull}), since the former contains only
two frequencies rather than three. Again, however, Daya Bay cannot resolve
between $\Delta_{31}$ and $\Delta_{32}$, so there is no practical loss in sensitivity with
this approach. The advantage of it is that it produces a single value that is
independent of the mass hierarchy and immune to changes wrought by updates to
\(\Delta m^2_{21}\).

\(\Delta m^2_{ee}\), as used here, has an \emph{operational,} rather than a physical,
definition: It is simply the value that, when inserted into
(\ref{eq:survProbDybEE}), gives the best fit to the data.
%
\begin{comment}
  Note that, if Daya Bay only measured antineutrinos at a single $L/E$, we could
  instead have made a truly physical definition of $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ by declaring
  that
  \[ \sin^2 \Delta_{ee} \equiv \cos^2\theta_{12} \sin^2 \Delta_{31} + \sin^2\theta_{12} \sin^2 \Delta_{32}. \]
  However, the righthand side of this definition depends on $L/E$, so unless
  this dependence is shown to be negligible, it cannot be used in broadband
  analyses such as Daya Bay's.
\end{comment}
%
In Daya Bay's case, however, \(\Delta m^2_{ee}\) can be related to physical
quantities to a very good degree of approximation. Returning to
(\ref{eq:survProbDybFull}), it can be shown [XXX docDB 10497] that, in Daya
Bay's range of $L/E$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dmPhi}
  \cos^2\theta_{12} \sin^2\Delta_{31} + \sin^2\theta_{12}\sin^2\Delta_{32}
  \approx \sin^2 (\Delta_{32} \pm \phi),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \phi \equiv \arctan\left( \frac{\sin2\Delta_{21}}{\cos2\Delta_{21}+ \tan^2
      \theta_{12}} \right),
\end{equation*}
and ``+'' (``-'') corresponds to the normal (inverted) hierarchy. Inserting
(\ref{eq:dmPhi}) into (\ref{eq:survProbDybFull}) and comparing to
(\ref{eq:survProbDybEE}) gives the approximate relation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dmPhiApprox}
  \Delta m^2_{ee} \approx \abs{\Delta m^2_{32}} \pm \Delta m^2_\phi/2,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta m^2_\phi = \frac{4\phi E}{L}.
\end{equation*}
Although $\Delta m^2_\phi$ depends on $L/E$, for Daya Bay it is essentially constant and
equal to \(\cos^2\theta_{12}\Delta m^2_{21}\). Inserting that into (\ref{eq:dmPhiApprox}),
we find that, for both mass hierarchies,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dmPhysical}
  \Delta m^2_{ee} \approx \cos^2\theta_{12}\abs{\Delta m^2_{31}} + \sin^2\theta_{12}\abs{\Delta m^2_{32}}.
\end{equation}
For all intents and purposes, this approximation is exact at Daya Bay. Hence
(\ref{eq:dmPhysical}) can be used to relate Daya Bay's measured
\(\Delta m^2_{ee}\), as operationally defined by (\ref{eq:survProbDybEE}), to the
physical mass splittings (XXX show how). Of course, in doing so, one must still
specify the mass hierarchy and \(\Delta m^2_{21}.\) As a sanity check, Daya Bay has
compared the results of fitting (\ref{eq:survProbDybFull}) and
(\ref{eq:survProbDybEE}), finding that, in the end, both techniques give the
same values of \(\abs{\Delta m^2_{32}}\) and \(\abs{\Delta m^2_{31}}\). For the sake of
simplicity, this thesis's analysis will use (\ref{eq:survProbDybEE}) and fit
\(\Delta m^2_{ee}\).

\section{Reactor neutrinos}
\label{sec:introReactor}

\section{Relevance of $\theta_{13}$ to future research}
\label{sec:futureRelevance}

The value of $\theta_{13}$ on its own does not carry any particularly meaningful
physical significance. However, $\theta_{13}$ is important in the context of
unraveling two extremely significant properties of neutrinos: The mass hierarchy
(MH), and the value of $\dcp$. In this context, the importance of $\theta_{13}$
arises simply from the fact that the MH and $\dcp$ both influence oscillation
probabilities via higher-order terms that are controlled by e.g.
\(\sin^2\theta_{13}\) or \(\sin^2 2\theta_{13}\); thus, a larger $\theta_{13}$ implies a
greater experimental sensitivity to these subtle effects. In turn, the MH and
$\dcp$ are pivotal in relation to two of the biggest questions in particle
physics: The Majorana nature (or lack thereof) of the neutrino, and the origin
of the the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe, respectively.

\subsection{Majorana neutrinos and the mass hierarchy}
\label{sec:majorana}

In the SM, the neutrino is a simple two-component left-handed \emph{Weyl}
spinor. Once mass is added, however, the picture necessarily becomes more
complicated. Massive spinors can be classified as either of Majorana or Dirac
type. A Majorana spinor is, by definition, one that is invariant under the
operation of charge conjugation (i.e., it is identical to its antiparticle). A
Dirac spinor, on the other hand, is not self-conjugate, and contains twice as
many components.

For a Majorana spinor, the Hamiltonian can contain a term (the Majorana mass)
that contributes to the particle's mass and creates particle-particle pairs.
Obviously, this is impossible if the particle carries any sort of conserved
charge, as is the case for every particle of the SM, except (after electroweak
symmetry breaking) the neutrino. Thus, the neutrino could prove to be the first
known fundamental Majorana fermion, and if this is so, it would also provide the
first example (via the Majorana mass) of lepton number violation.

The possible Majorana nature of the neutrino is closely related to the question
of the smallness of the neutrino mass scale. Taking a step back, the simplest
model of neutrino mass (which furnishes Dirac neutrinos) can be constructed in
analogy with the masses of the other fermions: We introduce a sterile
$\nu_{\text{R}}$ and construct a Yukawa coupling between it, the Higgs field, and
the active $\nu_{\text{R}}$. The lack of a Majorana mass term means that
$\nu_{\text{R}}$ and $\nu_{\text{L}}$ can be combined into a single Dirac spinor.
Although this construction works, it suffers from the fact that the
dimensionless coupling constant must be extremely small, of order
$m_\nu/m_{\text{EW}}$.

An alternative (and generally more favored) model of neutrino mass is described
by the \emph{seesaw mechanism}. In this case, sterile right-handed neutrino
fields $\nuR$ are introduced, self-coupled via Majorana mass term near the GUT
scale. (Such Majorana masses are not allowed for the funamental $\nuL$ fields as
they carry weak hypercharge.) In addition, Dirac mass terms are introduced,
linking $\nuR$ and $\nuL$ at the electroweak scale. The resulting mass matrix
contains three small and three large eigenvalues, with the small ones being of
the order \(m^2_{\text{EW}} / m_{\text{GUT}}\). The corresponding eigenstates
behave as Majorana particles: They are self-conjugate, and they have a Majorana
mass term (leading to $L$ violation). This model thus naturally generates small
neutrino masses. Furthermore, the heavy sterile neutrinos are a fairly generic
prediction of GUT and other BSM theories. Finally, even more generic higher
dimensional operators can also be shown to generate Majorana mass terms in the
effective low-energy theory. For these reasons, the theory community regards
Majorana neutrinos as a likely fact of nature. The experimental challenge is
then to find experimental evidence of the Majorana neutrino.

The hypothetical process of neutrinoless double beta decay ($\ndbd$) holds the
key to potentially observing evidence of Majorana neutrinos. In ordinary double
beta decay, an isotope emits two electrons and two antineutrinos. A Majorana
mass would allow the two antineutrinos to ``annihiliate'', leading to a small
peak at the endpoint of the double beta spectrum. If this peak is observed, it
would constitute definitive evidence of the Majorana nature of the neutrino,
with profound implications for BSM model building.

The rate of $\ndbd$ is proportional to the square of the \emph{effective
  Majorana mass} of the electron neutrino,
\begin{equation*}
  m_{\beta\beta} \equiv \left| \sum m_i U^2_{ei} \right|,
\end{equation*}
in which the unknown Majorana phases of the $U_{ei}$ can interfere with each
other. It turns out that the mass hierarchy has important implications when it
comes to the range of possible values of $m_{\beta\beta}$. For a given hierarchy, the
three neutrino masses are uniquely determined by the mass $m_l$ of the lightest
one, since the values of $\Delta m^2$ are known. Then, for a given $m_l$ (and
hierarchy), the possible range of $m_{\beta\beta}$ is determined by varying the three
Majorana phases. For $m_l$ above $\sim0.1$~eV, the two hierarchies give largely the
same $m_{\beta\beta}$ ranges. However, at lower $m_l$ the two hierarchies differ
considerably. In the case of the inverted hierarchy, $m_{\beta\beta}$ remains above
$\sim0.01$~eV for all $m_l$. On the other hand, under the normal hierarchy, the
Majorana phases can cancel completely when $m_l$ is between $\sim2$ and 8~meV
(making $\ndbd$ unobservable). Below 2~meV, $m_{\beta\beta}$ is bounded from below, but
its range lies an order of magnitude below that for the IH case. See Fig. XXX.

The upcoming generation of $\ndbd$ experiments seek to probe the entire range of
$m_{\beta\beta}$ values allowed by the inverted hierarchy. Therefore, \emph{if it is
  established that the mass ordering is inverted,} then a null result from these
$\ndbd$ experiments would demonstrate conclusively that \emph{the neutrino is
  not a Majorana particle.} Meanwhile, if the normal hierarchy is confirmed,
then it becomes impossible to disprove the Majorana nature of the neutrino,
since it may be hiding beneath a very small value of $m_{\beta\beta}$. (Of course,
proving, as opposed to disproving, the Majorana nature remains possible via
observation of $\ndbd$.) The mass hierarchy thus is extremely relevant to the
task of determining the nature of neutrino mass, and, in turn, the large value
of $\theta_{13}$ makes it possible to determine the MH via oscillation experiments.

\subsection{Baryon asymmetry and $\dcp$}
\label{sec:baryonAsym}

The Sakharov conditions state the requirements for producing a matter-antimatter
asymmetry (equivalently, a baryon asymmetry):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Processes that violate baryon number symmetry $B$; otherwise, every baryon
  would be created in concert with an antibaryon
\item Processes that violate C and CP symmetry; otherwise the C and
  CP-conjugates of $B$-violating interactions would cancel out the asymmetry
\item Lack of thermal equilibrium; otherwise, every process would be
  counterbalanced by its CPT-conjugate
\end{enumerate}
Within the SM, an asymmetry can be produced via the mechanism of electroweak
baryogenesis. However, the only source of CP violation in the SM is the complex
phase in the CKM matrix, and it is not at all clear that this effect alone is
large enough to account for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. If the
neutrino $\dcp$ is found to deviate significantly from zero (or $\pi$), then this
would constitute a brand new source of CP violation, and if the effect is large
enough, it could fully explain our matter-dominated universe when harnessed by a
BSM mechanism such as leptogenesis. Thus, $\dcp$, in a sense, could play a
critical role in explaining why the universe is not a mere sea of photons.

Meanwhile, knowledge of the mass hierarchy would also carry significant
implications. On a practical level, it would ease the determination of $\dcp$:
Many proposed experiments, particularly those that take advantage of matter
effects, suffer from a degeneracy between $\dcp$ and the mass hierarchy, forcing
them to quote two, possibly very different, confidence intervals for $\dcp$. But
if the mass hierarchy is known, these experiments all become a great deal more
powerful.

Most physical interactions are CP-symmetric; that is, in aggregate they produce
matter and antimatter in equal amounts.
