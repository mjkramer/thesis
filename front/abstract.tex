The Daya Bay experiment measures the oscillation of electron antineutrinos produced by the Daya Bay and Ling Ao-I \& II power plants (totaling 17.X GW$_\mathrm{th}$) in southern China. The flux and spectrum are observed using eight functionally identical Gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator detectors, with a total target mass of 120~T, divided among two near and one far experimental halls, resulting in varying baselines of order 500~m and 2~km, near and far. Using a sample of over 2~M events from $\sim$6 livetime-years of data, this work describes a spectral measurement of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and effective mass splitting $\Delta m^2_{ee}$, proceeding from raw data through calibration, reconstruction, event selection, background subtraction, and finally to a fit that yields $\sin^2 2\theta_{13} = 0.845 \pm 0.06\,\mathrm{(syst.)} \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{(stat.)}$ and $\Delta m^2_{ee} = 2.34 \pm 0.23\,\mathrm{(syst.)} \pm 0.34\,\mathrm{(stat.)} \times 10^{-5}$~eV$^2$. In addition, we perform a 2D search for a light sterile neutrino, setting stringent limits on $\sin^2 2\theta_{14}$ for $10^{-5} < \Delta m^2_{41} < 10^{-2}$. Compared to previous Daya Bay publications, a novel feature of this analysis is the joint optimization of event selection criteria, resulting in an average 42$\%$ reduction in the uncertainty of the measured oscillation parameters.
