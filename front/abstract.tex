The Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment measures the oscillation of electron antineutrinos produced by the Daya Bay and Ling Ao-I \& II Power Plants (totaling 17.4 GW$_\mathrm{th}$) in southern China. The fluxes and spectra of the antineutrinos are observed using eight functionally identical gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator detectors, with a total target mass of 160 tons, divided among two near and one far experimental halls, resulting in baselines of order 500~m (near) and 2~km (far). The oscillation phenomenon appears as a deficit of electron antineutrinos at the far hall relative to the yield at the near halls. Using a sample of over 2 million events from $\sim$6 years of livetime, this work describes a spectral measurement proceeding from raw data through calibration, reconstruction, event selection, background subtraction, and finally to a fit that yields $\sin^2 2\theta_{13} = 0.849 \pm 0.00287$ and $\Delta m^2_{ee} = (2.47 \pm 0.0715) \times 10^{-5}$~eV$^2$.
%
% In addition, we perform a 2D search for a light sterile neutrino, setting stringent limits on $\sin^2 2\theta_{14}$ for $10^{-5} < \Delta m^2_{41} < 10^{-2}$. Compared to previous Daya Bay analyses, a novel feature of this work is the comprehensive variation of event selection criteria, providing, for the first time, a quantitative demonstration that the analysis is stable with respect to such variations and that there is no need to alter the standard criteria for the sake of minimizing the uncertainty on the oscillation parameters.
