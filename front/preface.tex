Collaboration is an essential feature of science, and this is certainty true when it comes to Daya Bay. The results in this thesis would have been impossible without the efforts of many individuals who have contributed to the experiment (and its analysis) over the years. In order to present a coherent whole, this thesis attempts to adequately detail every relevant feature of the experiment, and every step along the journey from raw data to final result. Some of those details represent this author's original work, while others are the work of fellow collaborators. In the text, we have aimed to be clear about which contributions are our own, and for those that aren't, we provide references. For the sake of any reader who wishes to dive into this author's original work, we highlight here some of the author's personal contributions to the experiment and analysis, with references to further discussion in the text.
