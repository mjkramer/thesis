  abstract =     {The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is designed to
                  determine precisely the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$
                  with a sensitivity better than 0.01 in the parameter
                  sin$^22\theta_{13}$ at the 90 \% confidence level. To achieve
                  this goal, the collaboration will build eight functionally
                  identical antineutrino detectors. The first two detectors have
                  been constructed, installed and commissioned in Experimental
                  Hall 1, with steady data-taking beginning September 23, 2011.
                  A comparison of the data collected over the subsequent three
                  months indicates that the detectors are functionally
                  identical, and that detector-related systematic uncertainties
                  exceed requirements.},
