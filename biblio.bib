  abstract =     {The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is designed to
                  determine precisely the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$
                  with a sensitivity better than 0.01 in the parameter
                  sin$^22\theta_{13}$ at the 90 \% confidence level. To achieve
                  this goal, the collaboration will build eight functionally
                  identical antineutrino detectors. The first two detectors have
                  been constructed, installed and commissioned in Experimental
                  Hall 1, with steady data-taking beginning September 23, 2011.
                  A comparison of the data collected over the subsequent three
                  months indicates that the detectors are functionally
                  identical, and that detector-related systematic uncertainties
                  exceed requirements.},

abstract = {The observations from the Homestake radiochemical solar neutrino experiment over the period 1970 to 1992 are given. The observations will be compared to those from the Kamiokande II experiment, the gallium experiments and solar model calculations. A discussion is given of the question of a possible variation of the solar neutrino flux in anticorrelation with the solar activity cycle. The operation of the Homestake experiment, the sensitivity to the solar neutrino spectrum, the background processes and the various tests that have been performed are given in some detail. The Homestake and Kamiokande II experiments are compared on the basis of the standard model and the flux of 8B neutrinos. There is agreement between these two experiments during the period June 1987 to April 1990 when both experiments were observing. The average 8B neutrino flux during this period was (2.2 ± 0.2) × 106 cm−2sec−1. A non-standard solar model of Sienkiewicz, Bahcall, and Paczynski (1990) which presumes that 50% of the core of the Sun is continually mixed on a slow time scale accounts for this reduced 8B flux and the total neutrino capture rate of the chlorine and gallium experiments.}
